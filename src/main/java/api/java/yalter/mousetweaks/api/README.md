#Mouse Tweaks API

## IMTModGuiContainer2
If your container isn't based on GuiContainer, or if you want to improve compatibility (marking certain slots as ignored by the mod as an example), take a look at this interface. Implement it on your GuiScreen-based container.

## IMTModGuiContainer2Ex
Extended version of the previous interface, adds an ability to override the slot clicking function.

## @MouseTweaksIgnore
Putting this annotation on your GuiContainer is a quick and easy way to disable Mouse Tweaks on the container without having to implement the whole API interface.

## @MouseTweaksDisableWheelTweak
Putting this annotation on your GuiContainer is a quick and easy way to disable the wheel tweak on the container without having to implement the whole API interface.

## IMTModGuiContainer
This is an old, deprecated and bad interface which you shouldn't use.
